When setting up auto-backup you may notice that cloud providers such as Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.. Do not appear in the list of available storage locations. This is because they do not propertly implement the standard Android file saving protocol. This guide will help you work around this limitation.

The best solution is to simply auto-backup to a folder on your device and use another app to sync this folder with cloud storage provider.
