Your accounts stored in Google Authenticator can be transferred to Authenticator Pro with the "Transfer Accounts" feature. They cannot be imported directly because Android security prevents apps from reading the private data of other apps.

The procedure is as follows:

- Open Google Authenticator and click the menu icon in the top right.
- Select Transfer accounts
- Follow the instructions and you will be presented with a QR code containing your account data.
- You can scan this code with Authenticator Pro and your accounts will be transferred.

## Tips for scanning the code

Google Authenticator blocks screenshots so you cannot copy the code and scan it on the same device directly.
Here are a couple of methods for getting the code scanned:

- Use another device (B) to take a picture of the code on the screen of device A. Scan the picture you just took from the screen of device B with Authenticator Pro on device A.
- Bypass the screenshot block, here is a guide that may help: [How to take a screenshot in Android when an app doesn't want you to](https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/05/11/how-to-take-a-screenshot-in-android-when-an-app-doesnt-want-you-to/)

## Import not working / code not scanning?

The more information dense a QR code is, the harder it is to read. For best results try importing in batches of 3-4 at a time.
