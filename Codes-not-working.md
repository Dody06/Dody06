A common issue that many users report, is that the generated codes are not accepted when they try to log in (Facebook more often than not).

**The time on your device is most likely wrong!**

Authenticator Pro is not aware of the correct time as it does not connect to the Internet. You must make sure that the time on your device is as accurate as possible. A difference of a few seconds may result in the codes being invalid.

Use [time.is](https://time.is/) to check the accuracy of the clock on your device.

Make sure that you have automatic date/time enabled in your device settings. This will synchronise the clock with your mobile network.
