## Frequently Asked Questions

### I've entered the code and it's not working, what should I do?

Make sure that the time on your device is correct. Sync with a mobile network if possible for better accuracy.

### I cannot access my accounts because I cleared the data on my phone without creating a backup. Can you help me?

No

### Is Authenticator Pro available / coming to iOS?

No and probably not. Publishing an app on the App Store requires that you pay a annual $99 fee. Furthermore, you must own Apple hardware to develop an app in the first place.

### Will you implement [feature]?

Maybe

### Can you add an icon?

Yes. Create a request in a GitHub issue or [do it yourself](https://github.com/jamie-mh/AuthenticatorPro/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#icons) if you'd like.

### Can you add sync to Google Drive, OneDrive, etc...

No. Syncing to cloud services would require the internet permission and heavy intrusive SDKs to support them. Also, they have a habit of changing the APIs often, which just requires more work.

### Does Authenticator Pro support [service]?

Probably. Authenticator Pro supports TOTP, HOTP, mOTP and Steam which covers most of the services. You can find a list of some of the supported services here: [Two Factor Auth List](https://twofactorauth.org/) (marked with "software token").

### How do I download the Wear OS companion app?

Open Google Play on your watch and click Apps on Your Phone. You should see Authenticator Pro in the list and you can download it.
